# Job Application Automation & Discovery Tool

## Overview

I built this project to address a problem I personally faced during my job search: finding and applying to relevant roles efficiently, especially when my background doesn’t fit neatly into a single job title.

Many job platforms rely heavily on keyword matching, which often filters out roles that are still a strong fit based on skills and experience. This tool is designed to reduce the manual effort involved in discovering opportunities and preparing applications, while keeping the user fully in control of all decisions.

## What This Project Does

This system assists with:
- Identifying job openings aligned with a user’s experience and role preferences
- Evaluating role fit beyond strict keyword matching
- Notifying the user with curated role descriptions
- Assisting with resume and cover letter preparation

All applications are reviewed and approved by the user before submission.

The goal is to streamline the job search process and reduce repetitive work, allowing users to focus on evaluating opportunities rather than manually searching and re-entering information.

## Responsible Use

This project is built to respect platform rules and application policies:
- Uses public job listings and approved data sources
- Does not bypass authentication, CAPTCHA, or platform protections
- Does not submit applications without user confirmation

It is intended as an assistive tool, not a replacement for user judgment.

## Tech Stack

- Python
- Applied AI / LLM-based tools
- Resume and text analysis
- Modular agent-style workflows

## Status

This project is actively under development and being iterated on based on real usage.
